# Variable-Editor
This is a Qlik Sense mashup which allows Qlik Sense users to view, search and export variables from Qlik Sense environment (server or desktop) for any applications. This is the first iteration of this mashup using the capability API.

# Why...
Qlik Sense UI currently does not have seach functionality to search through the all variables. It also does not have any deature to export them out of the app. This mashup should provide easy access to those functionality wihtout the need for configuring anything else.
